# Best Practices for React + TypeScript + Webpack Template

This project is a modern template for scalable React applications using TypeScript and Webpack. Follow these best practices to ensure maintainability, performance, and code quality.

---

## 1. Unit Testing
- **Write tests for all logic and UI components.** Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
- **Aim for 90%+ coverage.** Exclude boilerplate, config, and index files from coverage.
- **Test edge cases and error states.** Mock APIs and test both success and failure scenarios.
- **Use descriptive test names** and group related tests with `describe` blocks.
- **Run tests locally and in CI** before merging code.

## Test Coverage Caveats
- While this template aims for 90%+ branch coverage globally, 100% branch coverage is not always achievable for every file (e.g., service files with implicit returns or unreachable branches).
- In such cases, the Jest configuration slightly lowers the branch threshold for those files. All meaningful logic and error paths are still covered by tests.

## 2. Performance
- **Code splitting:** Use dynamic `import()` for large or rarely used components.
- **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Optimize images:** Use modern formats and lazy loading for images.
- **Minimize bundle size:** Remove unused dependencies and use tree-shaking.
- **Use production builds:** Always deploy using `yarn build` (Webpack production mode).

## 3. Code Quality & DRY Principles
- **Keep components small and focused.** Each component should do one thing well.
- **Reuse components and utilities.** Place shared logic in `utils/` or as custom hooks.
- **Avoid code duplication.** Extract repeated logic into functions or components.
- **Use TypeScript for type safety.** Define clear types and interfaces for props, state, and API responses.
- **Consistent naming conventions.** Use PascalCase for components, camelCase for variables/functions.
- **Comment complex logic.** Use comments to explain non-obvious code.

## 4. Project Structure
- **Organize by feature or domain.** Group related files (components, views, services) together.
- **Use index files for exports.** Simplifies imports and improves maintainability.
- **Separate config, mocks, and layout.** Keep configuration, mock data, and layout components in their own folders.

## 5. Improvements & Recommendations
- **Add E2E tests** (e.g., Cypress or Playwright) for critical user flows.
- **Linting and formatting:** Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style.
- **Accessibility:** Use semantic HTML and test with screen readers.
- **Error boundaries:** Use and customize `ErrorBoundary.tsx` for robust error handling.
- **Environment variables:** Store secrets and endpoints in `.env` files, not in code.
- **Continuous Integration:** Use GitHub Actions or similar for automated testing and deployment.

## 6. Documentation
- **Document components and utilities.** Use JSDoc or TypeScript doc comments.
- **Update README.md** with setup, usage, and contribution guidelines.
